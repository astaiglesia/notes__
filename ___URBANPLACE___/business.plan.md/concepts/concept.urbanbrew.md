# the urbanbrew || urbancafe story     // [] damnit! just realized the name is too derivative ... need to re-ideate
coffeehut alcove | beer + wine | artisinal food hall | grab n go market | event space + collaboration | neighborhood hub


## our  vision and organizational philosophy
to be a multi-purpose foodery, market and cafe social hub, encompassing the spirit of the use case neighborhoods and establishments in our visionboard.


We've taken heavy cues from some amazing establishments and cafe cultures, especially this enthusiast's favorite - Prague who's rich and amazing culture inspired the urbanbrew identity. modeling our program concepts, themes, business model and organizational philosophy after places like Vnitrobloc, Kavárna V Sedmém Nebi, cafedu, SF's marina district 

> basic program tenets
- open early for the morning commute to open late 
  - various sections may open, close or repurpose though

- food option variants through the day
  - provide in house grab and go options
  - provide seated guest selections

- morning to evening brews - coffee and beer through the day as allowed by law 
  - beer and wine only... full liquor license if restaurant option is employed or its easy to obtain (good to have)

- multi threaded parent operation deploying a microservice architecture (flexibly run internally or by a sub-tenant)

- the reservation system (electronic / web app to be dev'd) is designed to encourage community discourse, while reducing internal overhead. the user creates an account and reserves on our web app (encouraging marketing signup and application use) 


> urbanplace is a multi-threaded operation designed to deliver on several needed services, local-life options and personality to the increasingly dense and vibrant city neighborhood, just itching for more options to actually live IN Journal Square.  
to help share our idea, here are some concept user stories


> ## entering the alcove: a normal flow: a concept program design walk through the space   [] embed dwg's and storyboard images

- i walk by a small, approx 10x10 sidewalk cafe space that leads to the retail's main entry. a rollup door centers the build...  on nicer days this initiates a unified indoor/outdoor space and beckons all passer-bys of a somewhat open door policy

- wafting through the open entry way, the smell of fresh baked goods, belgian waffles and brewing coffee calls to me on the crisp, fall day and i drift in

- i enter the alcove market situated in a 35' x ~11' x 12'h (usable sf) hall-like space which is to be clearly de-lineated with design features such as style, materials, colors. (actual floor area includes 5-6' of 5'h space being used to house countertops, grab n go display cases, refrigerated lowboys),
  - eating/quick stay counters and hightops dot the space along with tables and/or racks for baked goods and specialties + hard to find foods market + a few good staples that we feel every cupboard should have and/or try
    - specific products will vary by season and adjust to community feedback
  
- there's a cashier-type employee setup in a built up counter section taking coffee, waffle and smoothie orders while also ringing up market purchases while another staff or 2 works on those orders and supports the inner cafe business as needed

- i hear the cashier mention to a guest that they can sit at any unreserved and open table, but to get the choice spots that she would want to sign up on our app and use the reservation system, so i do just that while i'm eyeing all the market nom noms...
  - wow! these grab n go options are legit, super healthy ones and also those comfort foods when we don't care about calories. lol. i can't find this anywhere else in the hood and their made in-house! best of all, a single meal itself basically costs the same as delivery fees and tip if i ordered on grubhub!, why wouldn't i pass by on my home or at any point. why cook myself when im tired?! ooooh and breakfst stuff too on top of all these pastries?! sold sold sold. on every day of the week =) 
  
- but not today - looking beyond the alcove, I see the main cafe area ... cool concrete? with large amounts of light pouring through skylights and glazing at the far end.
  - i see the outline of metal pan stairs with a bit of raised section that draws my curiousity 
  - i get to the edge of the alcove where the tone switch indicates a separate use case


> ## the cafe / restaurant flow
- as i reach the edge of the alcove, i notice a set of stairs heading the sub-level RR's
- I'm also greeted by some sort of local artist's work alongside a couple of small pop-ups from local artisans
  - one is food related, the other is some sort of lifetyle products

> res system description: (web app feature)
  - each reservable table/seating area shall have a display of some sort indicating the space's current reservation status and/or schedule
  - guests who make a purchase in the alcove market or order food with the cafe kitchen is welcome to sit in any of our spaces  on a first-come first-serve basis. including the tables bound by reservations
  - the ONE and ONLY rule governing reservations is that those who have a reservation has right of way. we reserve the right to eject any guest that is unwilling to cede in this case
    - e.g. an empty table has a reservation noted in 20 minutes, I sit and enjoy until that person comes... if that person no-shows, I don't have to get up unless the next reservation arrives
  - reservation slots will be application capped to 4 hr segments (max of 1.5 hour during specified mealtimes)
    - only a single 4 hr reservations is allowed per day but can conceivably sit down in the morning and remain uninterruped by reservation until my 4 hr slot, and then again remain uninterrupted until close.
    - the only rule to regulate this situation is to help support the business by making addtl purchases, coffee, dessert, meals, etc.  every couple hours
      - mgmt discretion will apply sufficient purchases for the individual or group


- to discourage excessive vehicular traffic, incease neighborhood supporting walk factor, while decreasing our carbon footprint, as well as embody the spirit of the JS Redev plan -> all to go's orders will eventually be managed by our website with ==> NO external food delivery svc orders will be accepted (web app to be dev'd)





our manifesto: [] do we like manifesto?

- first and foremost - we will not rush or push you, but these are the house rules
  
  - you can sit in any of our spaces
- rather  encourage you to stay for a while.  
- by providing a variety services and goods in the space

Urbanbrew's concept was to be a multi-threaded operation by design from conception, again in Prague - specifically within the [Vinitroblock space](https://vnitroblock.cz/). The venue contributes to the business model on so many notes. 


Though scaled-down for our use case, our program...

**urbanbrew/urbanplace** 
is designed to be a community hub that will draw the nieghborhood in its direction for any number of program possibliities and options. construction is purposefully modular in nature and thoughtfully engineered design allowing for multiple use case iterations, expansions and repurposing that allows the overall identity to persist while 'features' can cater to the neighborhoods needs









We want to help drive our neighborhood persona and be proud be a part of what makes Journal Square a neighborhood that's always comes up in any apartment hunter's search flow



The vision's viability is capability supported by the tens of 1000's of hours that our family has spent living and breathing our model's core program areas of hospitality, food service administration, culinary gastronomy, nightlife, music, art, event planning and coordination, digital marketing... while the property's constructibility is buoyed by the core team's decades of construction administration. 


[] move to bio: our founder leads our vision with high levels of [experience in all areas of our operations](insert link to bio)



Growing up in the very property aimed to be developed, our goals and ideals blend these passions for both healthy and luxuriously unhelthy eating, cafe culture and social hub that my friends and I had so desperately wanted in the neighborhood as a young adult.

Indeed we've hosted hundreds of friends and family into 61 Cottage for the last 4 decades. It's always been a place to get fed awesome food, have a beer with friends, listen to great music or just simply hang on a couch with our laptops - silently appreciating the shared  company as we hack away. 


while the initial plan is to launch as a retail cafe & restaurant, my final vision is to modernize and 

*re-create and modernize the neighborhood hub where friends have always gotten together to be fed by my cooking, enjoy great music and food, hang out, play games, lounge about... that my house has and, with this project, will always will be*

- to this effect, with only the effort needed to reach out to each individual, we can literally have hundreds of jersey city residents (past and present) sign off that they have done any, and likely all, of these things, and in that house. if this business existed when I was a child, the place would probably be landmarked by now. 

This vision 100% allows 61 Cottage redevelopment to continue on in this role

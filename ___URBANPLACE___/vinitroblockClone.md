> Business Vision 
- Vnitroblock Inspired
cafedu/prague seating resrvation system
- 'Stick around for a while mentality'
- 'beers and brews' prague-like cafe culture (wine and beer bar for brunch and happy hours, pregame, low key evening) 
- provides a variety of diverse revenue streams, low maintenance/overhead cost
- ability to modularize with tenants, let the market dictate, provide a space to support the local artisans
- can easily self-fill spaces between tenants
- the varied business types draws in cross-traffic with a stick around situation
  - greenhouse can tie it all together to drive traffic to the other support businesses

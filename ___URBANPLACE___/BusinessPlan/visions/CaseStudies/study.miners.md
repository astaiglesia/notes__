# THE MINERS - Slavikova 
> Slavikova, Praha (visited Nov '22)

Prague's coffee culture is so rich and diverse that this beautiful cafe initially didn't even gain consideration as a use case aside from one prime inspirational photo I had taken. In retrospect, while vnitroblock appeals to my edgy, blue collar, industrial/builder's persona, my architecturally driven side has aligns with and uses handfuls of design cues from this location of the somewhat locally premium coffee brand

## meta
> *business description*
> * Miners is a czech roastery that delivers their product in a top notch package appealing to its premium nature and clientele. In typical praha style there's loads of seating to stick around and study, surf the web, eat, etc. 
> * Lacks a food service presence here but excellent presentation of coffee and pastries

> *additional context to note*
> * brand recognition of Miners in Praga apppears comparable to Blue Bottle in NYC or Groundwork, Intelligentsia out of LA

<div> the low hanging fruit. clean, simple yet bold. i don't love-love it but the style does appeal to me. the cups have the same understated yet bold motif that certainly delivered a premium vibe.  I'll leave it at that til the next one.</div>

> ### BLEACHERS
<hr>

<div>This showcased design element in this case study, while the exact layout and final execution varies from the 61 retail concept, the same design intents and elements are present in our concept</div>


* upon entry, users are greeted by the feature stairs, pulling them toward the bright airy space. an eye catcher for sure, integrating varied sightlines and textures, engages the guest by generating tons of visual interest, while users are also able to nestle themselves into a fun and informal work flow that's also fully modular 
  - 61 cottage takes this sentiment and places the feature at the end of a long narrow corridor. an overhead skylight floods the platform with natural light. the planned offset in colors should immediately catch guest eyes and draw them further in, with popup(s) along the way to further distract and lead to user retention

> **implementing the clean long straights of this bleacher feature would echo the historic architectural style of the landmark Journal Square Trans Ctr, a key point noted in the redev plan, and which is predominantly featured in the southern view from the property . the long, over-wide concrete partition walls serves architecturally minimal seating options**

<br>
<br>
<br>

> We'll revisit this in later discussions on [motifs] (#motif), however, this is about as close to the vibe and color pallette I've envisioned 
- the cool concrete tile of the bleacher steps, with cushions are basically one step higher than my ROM design. 
- the wooden boxes provide a flat working surface and adds a warm touch that matches the wooden steps.... 
  - [] *definitely use this* at 61 - wood runs (cost permitting) are on the short list of stair materials
- black steel railing providing a minimally thin, yet bold contrast against the whitewashed walls and 8'h glzing
- even the planters echo my idea to a t
- 61's bleachers and its furnishings can play off qbert nostalgia for the elder millenials out there. 
- the tiered platform seating concept will be located along the south wall and can be reconfigured into a small stage or dais. 
- couch by default but the space can easily flex.. Perfect for conference talks with simple option to add projection screen

> I love the modern feel being projected here
- bright white + sunlight dominance
- coolness of the concrete
- warm woods 
- thin lines of black painted steel
- selected greenery to add organic notes

high end finishes aren't necessary to convey a quality, premium feel throughout by utilizing thoughtful design

> ### STUDY & COWORKING HUB
<hr>
praha cafes often promote a coworking aspect to their spaces - 61cottage understands the isolation that can easily hit wfh's having had an excess of cabin fever with a lack of options... I've personally performed in that role for years and thrive working remotely but not always necessarily in my home. I love working from cafes, with a bit of white noise and human energy edging me on but we don't always feel welcome spending a few hours there.  our casual app driven reservation policy strives to give the neighborhoods apt dwellers another spot to spend a few hours hacking away or just getting out of the apt* 

* many of the cafes will also have dedicated 'quiet spaces' for those looking to do some deep thinking.
* again, the colors in the image below firmly align with our vision

### NARROWLY BUILT - SUCCESS!
<hr>

- no not narrowly a success... lol. the miners is an example of several narrow rooms / zones, built intelligently and beautifully resolving for the microservice at hand

- the study room is approx 12' wide
- the bleachers zone approx the same... 
- the store frontage / food prep area shown below appears to be a bit wider, maybe 15-16'? 

<img alt="the miners main vestibule" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1UBSv5AM_MfEBzACvOFOnW4d9bybwmILo" />

*note the lengthening effect of the mirror on the space. 61 cottage's alcove space will have a similar layout to this room if it was really as long as the mirror would have you believe*

<br>

> the point here is that none of these rooms are any wider than 61cottage. lay the rooms out railroad style and we have a similar blueprint to our concept... and we have the whole basement as well

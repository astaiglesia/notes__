# Vnitroblock - Holesovice 
> Holesovice, Praha (visited Nov '22)

[Vnitroblock](https://vnitroblock.cz/) is the driving inspiration for 61's retail program. The microservices paradigm in software aims to deploy self-contained and self-sufficient features that provide utility and synergy to the whole space while aiming to eliminate interdependencies between businesses

## meta
> *business description*
At the time I visited the ultra chic yet unpretentious, industrial reclamation space... the program's cafe core provides the anchor tenancy to the surrounding businesses and services.
> Vnitroblock's services and features included:
- core coworking cafe space with casual and table seating options
- conferencing space
- plant nursery
- retail main tenant + popups
- other adjacent businesses in the same central block development also feed into the vibe and flow of vinitroblock - the rising tide lifts all

> other use cases for the space include:
- parties
- special events

> Modeling 61 cottage's space and program after scaled down version of vnitroblock's approach would allow our overall retail program to be more responsive to the community's needs while eliminates single points of failure. 
>- We plan to [our org philosophy](./study.philosoph.md) takes a deeper dive into the patterns surrounding our business model.



> *additional context to note*
> in addition to the business model - vnitroblock's industrial warehouse architecture fits well in my overall design tastes. i love the urban-industrial 'hipster paradise' persona of the space and their fashion/arts/music event space penetration

<div>vnitroblock's strength is from their strong marketing and event programming. the space draws because of its tenants and builds buzz through their events. the spaces image and reputation is reminiscent of the the ROW complex in LA - converted warehouses that have been repurposed into upscale, artsy, hipsterish spaces that draws top talent exhibitions from different industries</div>

<div>inhouse plant nursery... with all the green thumbs in our family the plan is to have periodic pop up greenhouse sales on the roof, alcove and larger 'shows' in the main space</div>

<h3 id="motif">MOTIF </h3>
<hr>

- classic industrial feel of a warehouse reclamation, love it - the vibe and feel but don't think it will effectively scale down to the narrow space of 61's construct... particularly as its a new build
- items to note in the following visions:
  - the mix of spaces and seating types - couches, 2 topsl, 4 tops, communal tables
  - finished and weathered concrete floors, exposed brick, warm woods and leathers, exposed finished steel, exposed everything
  - study mezzanine execution... apparently its movable! ... don't need that but ya
  - exposed pipes is cool in the alcove if organically occuring but no need to specifically design
  - ample daylighting from the warehouse windows running the length of the property

- a bit too unfinished for our particular use case with an unreproducible authentic weathered feel 
- however the layout is is a decent model to value engineer the design to a low-key effet
- that communal table is a must (cb2 has some surprisingly inexpensive options)



**taking the vnitroblock's interior approach could be less expensive**

another example of a communal table that can be built inhouse

<h3 id="cafe"> CAFE SERVICE </h3>
<hr>
the coffee and food options at vnitroblock are good but not spectacular.
some specialty pastries and daily meal options sounded enticing
the space contains a full bar as well.
- glazing across the main counter space is to the conference space

<br>
<h3 id="art"> adding artistic touches is necessary </h3>

<hr>

the west wall of 61's main retail space may potentially be an unpenetrated wall (no glazing). we will need some wall art to add life to the space.. just a thought to bump about on the back burner

*maybe we can recreate this sentiment, along with the tables on the roof patio*

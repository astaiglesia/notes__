- core coworking cafe space with casual and table seating options
- conferencing space
- several retail popups
- other adjacent businesses in the same central block development also feed into the vibe and flow of vinitroblock - the rising tide lifts all

> other use cases for the space include:
- parties
- special events

Just as I've found the design-build method of construction integratges echoes of agile methodologies, our planned post-construction program operations can scale and resist single points of failure by not only providing an 'artisan mall' of options, but the cross-flow of uses and users that diversifies the revenue streams and increases clientele traffic.

aggregating these cues from my construction and software engineering experiences - I've intentionally designed 61's main space modular spaces and zones that can be easily repurposed to meet a wealthy variety many use cases. It should be noted that Vnitroblock is marketed as an event space

One of the core tenets of the agile manifesto is to value responsiveness to change over following a plan... Particularly important in a rapidly evolving community and demographic.
Modeling 61 cottage's space and program after vnitroblock's approach allows our overall retail program to be more responsive to the community's needs while eliminates single points of failure.

# THE MINERS - Slavikova 
> Slavikova, Praha (visited fall of 22)

Prague's coffee culture is so rich and diverse that this beautiful cafe initially didn't even gain consideration as a use case aside from one prime inspirational photo I had taken. In retrospect, while vnitroblock appeals to my edgy, blue collar, industrial/builder's persona, my architecturally driven side has aligns with and uses handfuls of design cues from this location of the somewhat locally premium coffee brand

## case study meta
> *business description*
> * Miners is a czech roastery that delivers their product in a top notch package appealing to its premium nature and clientele. In typical praha style there's loads of seating to stick around and study, surf the web, eat, etc. 
> * Lacks a food service presence here but excellent presentation of coffee and pastries

> *additional context to note*
> * I would compare the brand recognition of Miners in Praga to be similar to a Blue Bottle in NYC or Groundwork, Intelligentsia out of LA

<div> the low hanging fruit. clean, simple yet bold. i don't love-love it but the style does appeal to me. the cups have the same understated yet bold motif that certainly delivered a premium vibe.  I'll leave it at that til the next one.</div>

> ### BLEACHERS
<hr>

<div>This showcased design element in this case study, while the exact layout and final execution varies from the 61 retail concept, the same design intents and elements are present in our concept</div>


* upon entry, users are greeted by the feature stairs, pulling them toward the bright airy space. an eye catcher for sure, integrating varied sightlines and textures, engages the guest by generating tons of visual interest, while users are also able to nestle themselves into a fun and informal work flow that's also fully modular 
  - 61 cottage takes this sentiment and places the feature at the end of a long narrow corridor. an overhead skylight floods the platform with natural light. the planned offset in colors should immediately catch guest eyes and draw them further in, with popup(s) along the way to further distract and lead to user retention

> We'll revisit this in later discussions on [motifs] (#motif), however, this is about as close to the vibe and color pallette I've envisioned 
- the cool concrete tile of the bleacher steps, with cushions are basically one step higher than my ROM design. 
- the wooden boxes provide a flat working surface and adds a warm touch that matches the wooden steps.... 
  - [] *definitely use this* at 61 - wood runs (cost permitting) are on the short list of stair materials
- black steel railing providing a minimally thin, yet bold contrast against the whitewashed walls and 8'h glzing
- even the planters echo my idea to a t 
> - truth be told, 61's bleachers were inspired decades earlier by the hallowed Twilo spot of the same name as well as Q'Bert!
> that said, these images provide the exact mindspace for my tiered platform seating concept found along the south wall.

> **LASTLY - a final note onthe clean long straight lines of this concept feature: these echo the historically significant tone and style of the landmark Journal Square Trans Ctr, a key point noted in the redev plan. the long, over-wide concrete partition walls serves architecturally minimal seating options**


<h2 id="motif">motif </h2>

> I love the modern industrial feel being projected here
- bright white + sunlight dominance
- coolness of the concrete
- warm woods 
- thin lines of black painted steel

> ### STUDY & COWORKING HUB
much like a wework - *praha cafes often promote a coworking aspect to their spaces - 61cottage's org thrives in coworking spaces and will continue to push on that spirit* 

* many of the cafes will also have dedicated 'quiet spaces' for those looking to do some deep thinking.
* again, the colors in the image below firmly align with our vision

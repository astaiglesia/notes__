## I: STAIRS + MEZZ
- industrial build mezz stage over stairs down to kitchen
- Stairs to patio from mezz 
- Mezz serves as varied height seating + performance stage
   - thinking couch type seating here
- planters, uplighting (run electrical but postpone fixtures )
- skylight
- some sound deadening / proofing for noise mitigation
- restaurant storage/shelving under the mezz

phase 2 options:
- large translucent picture window on south wall for more light
- addtl sound deadening / proofing for noise mitigation as needed
- upgrade mezz finishes



<br>



## J: MAIN SPACE
long and open space flooded with light from above
cool neutral colors, warm woods, black iron
echo jstc's long extruded minimal block feel

pops of green from plants
local artists on the walls

flexible use options
- (default) cafe mode: eclectic seating for varied use cases 
   - couches and arm chairs : relax and lounge, laptop + tablet, close conversations
   - flat surfaces : communal table(s), perimeter bar height counters, coffee and side tables
   - millwork evoking history/jc cues :  
         * exchange place wood seats with highbacks and uplighting (near ukraine statue)
         * use jsq blocks to recreate twilo stairs / qbert blocks
- during full floor rent-outs including alcove
      * alcove displays + fridges to fit under res tunnel + decorative paneling
      * alcove counters repurposed as backbar and bar
- seated event space - bdays, engagement parties, conferencing
- long hall events - farmers markets, artisan/art shows, food stall hall, wine tasting, networking
- music performances ...


phase 2 options:
- introduce more formal dinner svc
- extend + expand market

<br>


## K: Alcove Market
- bright white colors pulling you in from the street
- large  / full height doors / roll-up door to the patio
- under the res tunnel(all can be hidden for full floor events):
   - fridge displays - drinks, grab n gos
   - storage
   - coffee / smoothie / liege waffle prep counter(s)
   - baked goods displays (is there room for ovens?? - exponential effect if the rollup is open and fresh bakery smells in the air)
   - market staples
   - 
- bar height counters opposite 



phase 2:
introduce a butchery to basement kitchen - support meats for restaurant iteration, sell in market

>RFI's / Revision considerations:
<hr>

A. How much leeway do we have with ordinances / redev plan?
   1. can we somehow  convince to build 4 floors (6 rental above ground floor retail) ++ no elev
   2. how can we game the 70' max length from right of way frontage... 
      a. is my understanding correct that the 70' is from the main entry?
         i. if we slide back the res entry ... is it 70' from that point (see **res-tunnel**)


B. Res tunnel to stairs 
   1. how can we design code compliant stairs to maximize residence floor areas
      a. 60"w res tunnel with recessed mailboxes on east wall
      b. 48" width stairs (min 42") 
      c. 42" landings + midlandings
      d. ~ 40-45% slope - this is an urban walkup on a narrow plot... super common to be steeper, but let's aim for high 30s if we could
   2. assume 2N is the family unit ()
         - need to figure out a smart design to accomdate the res tunnel bump... kitchen/dining platform?

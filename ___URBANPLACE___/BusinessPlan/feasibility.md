> [] **thoughts and considerations**
~~>     - 1 ph unit + 1 3rd fl unit are to be treated as family owned~~
~~>     - is mixed ownership type possible? ~~
~~>       - I like the idea to pay down interest accrued in big chunks with condo sales~~
> [] consider anchor tenants
>     - sell 1 ph unit for $450k post construction, if possible to knock down principal
>     - retail tenant(s) ideas
          * established grocer (name recognition, guaranteed income..)
          * established restaurant (Ama Jersey City)

## DESIGN ANALYSIS 
<hr>
review images in redev plan, find elements to echo

### MEP

[] MEP Consult on ROM design, informal discussions
### redesign per redev + master plans

[] what is restaurant category one and two???

[] [audit adherence to redev plan objectives](./zoning.md)
[] investigate design option where we can step down into a subgrade urban cafe (approx current)
  [] can we excavate for a full basement below that still? 
  [] can we slide in an urban cafe mezz (vnitroblock)?
[] facade considerations - materials, style
    - considerations:
      [] echo jstc style
      [] echo stanley theater
      [] if we can do a stepdown, echo original architectural style with stairs leading up to residential


[] major design option consideration - All adaptive reuse of existing structures shall not be required to meet minimum building
height requirements.


[] balloon construction - woodframed residential on concrete retail

[] verify front setback

[] 'Ground floor level may extend to 100% of the lot... but part ii states all floors above the ground shall not extend more than 70 feet from any right of way fronting the subject property' 
=> the blue house behind us is basically what can be built
=> can we incorporate a greenhouse and/or skylight feature?

[] are we legally obligated to notify rohan?
  - probably and if so, highly likely chance a partnership discussion will come up
  - are we completely against this? 
  - he can build 2 stories taller which may or may not matter
  - we can build 2 stories taller if we partner
    - more steady revenue + faster payoff
    - less reliant on the success of the retail
    - can revert to original design plan of 2 retail + 3 residential floors
    - my terms are for:
      - heavy architectural influence on facade and retail
      - full autonomy in my own units

      - and either:
      - implementation of my original concept but with elev&stair core area split

      -or- 
      
      - full retail floor control minus common lobby space
      - control of (1) unit on each floor (preferably stacked, with option to duplex)
      - handle building management for 1 addtl 4th floor unit 

[] if rohan wants to build at the same time
  - what are our conditions?
  

[] if rohan doesn't build at the same time 
  - what can I do if he builds higher than me (ask city planning)
  - vice versa

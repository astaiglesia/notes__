# __URBANPLACE__

> **notes on the documentation:**
> * predominantly written in markdown with links to associated documents maintained by the server [] verify privatized repo
    -> view right within github or download and open within a code editor like vscode
    -> these documents will form the intellectual framework of the entity's digital identity - marketing, branding and social 
> * as complexity grows, notes will be efforted to be maintained for field changes but may not always be exactly current
> *** i.e. - please question + address any conflicts or inconsistencies
>  
> * that said.. please check the following terms below to clarify any initial confusion re: workshopped names and/or personal unofficial nomenclature, overlapping name uses, etc. will be updated with any new terms implemented when identified - 
> * [] does this need to live in its own document?
> * [] when properly updated for finalized names - this list should project a corporate identity and unified theme and/or program concepts

> **working/-shopped names**
> * *urbanplace* - the overall corporate identity of the property entity
> * [ "", *urbanhome* ] - the residential identity of the property
> * [ *urbancafe*, *urbanbrew*,  ] - the retail entity
> * [*the alcove*, ] - 'coffee-cart' park / entry area
> * the above list should also be treated as the defacto location to place impulsive insprations - 
> * remember that final signage designations should occur much later down the road as we will let the community dictate the direction we take with the main restaurant space
> * while I am open to being convinced otherwise, regardless of any other final selections, my preference as vision author at this point is urbanplace. i will only be swayed by arguments made by architect or generally design inclined... 

[wip] begin case studies
## CASE STUDIES - an identity forming vision board  [#[] this should be iterated to the use case standard for opening any and all presentations#]
first and foremost - this is an argument for why i'm here doing all this
> ****

> - **we, the core organizational team, are a family of immigrants and first gens that moved into the property at 61 Cottage St in the late 70's and have owned it for over 50 years we have literally witnessed the neighborhood's evolution live and in real time and can each tell a lifetime of stories about living in jersey city. St.John's all through grammar school. Prep & ASA for high school...<add more> if nothing else, this is our childhood home and we, as with any longtime resident, deserve a say in how our community develops**
>
> - **MOREOVER =) as a family with builders combining over 80 years of construction administration at all project scales in the tri-state region and across the country, with an aggregate value likely in the $trillions. we understand better than most understand the benefits of smart and effective urban planning and development AND while we do have the construction expertise to self-administer the project, we can lean a support staff and consults consisting of industry professionals we've personally worked with across our  decades in the industry**
>





>  - **our vision is multi-threaded operation that aims to provide the sorely needed services, local-life options and personality to the increasingly dense and vibrant city neighborhood, just itching for more options to actually live IN Journal Square.  We want to help drive our neighborhood persona and be proud be a part of what makes Journal Square a neighborhood that's always comes up in any apartment hunter's search flow**
> all our residents, particularly those in our amazingly beautiful and equally tall municipal neighbors that are now spotted all throughout the journal square zone (within a 10 minute walking radius.
>     - The residences aim to provide that same demographic with alternative, smaller scale but with the modern urban architecture and building program that adds great social value'** 
>     - the project property has at least a dozen new construction highrises along with countless renovations, and smaller developments) with a demographic we believe 100% aligns with our target
>     - The very community which I grew up in since birth and have a hugely vested interest in providing my input in what direction the neighborhood I was born and raised in takes with the redevelopment of our childhood home
>








> - **if anybody can represent an organic and authentic jersey city image - past, present AND future, I can. we know we have this in the bag with a vision that will be:**
>   - 100% compliant with the redev plan's objectives and goals
>   - in particular, taking architectural cues from the surrounding neighborhood and historical elements we feel intimitely tied to
>   - provide the neighborhood with much needed services and a community where the locals can walk to, hang out and be locals
>
> **please refer to the [organizationl bios]() for details and creds


the following points of reference should provide a framework the urbanplace mindspaces    [wip] init from ideaboard [] architect likely to iterate
<br>

## **urban development & styles** 
> neighborhoods and mixed use urban developments whose personas, design cues and mixed use neighborhood & business patterns inspire this vision 
- Holesovice - Prague
- Arts District - Los Angeles
- Belltown, Capitol Hill, Pioneer Sq - Seattle
- Cow's Hollow and Marina retail corridor - San Francisco

> **we also understand the need for an architecural uniformity to tie the neighborhoods together**  [] init a pitch for redev plan ammendment 
- for this reason, and as the first property to develop along the final row of properties on the southside of cottage st between kennedy blvd and summit ave, we propose a plan ammendment to apply to these remaining row houses to more closely align with the extg and proposed predominant building facade and roof lines for the vast majority of the street, while promoting the maintainenance of the historically significant individual, non-corporate, personalized feel to the neighborhood and encouraging the development of a mixed use persona (it would be nice to have a row of restaurants for locals to choose from and increase the walkability factor of the street and surrounding streets):
  - new developments in noted area shall be allowed and encouraged to have a front facade adjoining the right of way(zero setback) if ground floor retail is employed
  - with this option - full lot length construction may be allowed through 2-3 floors, provided a secondary means of egress is provided for the area above the main floor AND beyond the ordinances stipulated max form ROW of 70', as well as automated fire suppression throughout those levels
  - the max height is raised by 1 story to be 4 stories @ 44'
  - the elevator requirement is removed on single-lot, 4 story developments

## **cafe culture**         []  def trim and splice out a vision write up
> that old school - low, key evening, no rush vibe, something that is generally lacking in the greater nyc metro area, blended with a modern, industrial vibe so we're not reliving an episode of Friends ... these example of amazing cafe cultures may be varied in execution but all drive the vibe to my vision. hip, modern, artisinal, relaxed, urban industrial found in  architectural and business patterns that have inspire this vision. As an older millenial, I myself am solidly in our target demographic. its just a natural given that new york is and always the central hub of the universe. there's no way around that - but we need an army of places like mine to bring the up to speed massive rise in development. I'm not some corporate suburban vision planner, i'm an local urbanite that's only ever lived in densely populate, mixed use areas. I've traveled extensively and have actively sought out cafe cultures - and I know that the Journal Square persona will benefit greatly from quality, local social hubs as is being proposed her... and really as it always has. even with rise of the grove street life, journal sq residents still had to hop in an uber or on the path to get anywhere interesting.  urbancafe is here to help start bridging that gap. these are my people, this is my home... i know what we need and how to deliver it.

### MEP
> [] MEP Consult on ROM design, informal discussions

### Arch
|--- *V2 REDESIGN PER JC REDEV & MASTER PLANS* ---|
> 
> [] what is restaurant category one and two???
> 
> [] [audit adherence to redev plan objectives](./zoning.md)
> [] investigate design option where we can step down into a subgrade urban cafe (approx current)
>   [] can we excavate for a full basement below that still? 
>   [] can we slide in an urban cafe mezz (vnitroblock)?
> [] facade considerations - materials, style
>     - considerations:
>       [] echo jstc style
>       [] echo stanley theater
>       [] if we can do a stepdown, echo original architectural style with stairs leading up to residential
> 
> 
> [] major design option consideration - All adaptive reuse of existing structures shall not be required to meet minimum building
> height requirements.
> 
> 
> [] balloon construction - woodframed residential on concrete retail
> 
> [] verify front setback
> 
> [] 'Ground floor level may extend to 100% of the lot... but part ii states all floors above the ground shall not extend more than 70 feet from any right of way fronting the subject property' 
> => the blue house behind us is basically what can be built
> => can we incorporate a greenhouse and/or skylight feature?
> 
> [] are we legally obligated to notify rohan?
>   - probably and if so, highly likely chance a partnership discussion will come up
>   - are we completely against this? 
>   - he can build 2 stories taller which may or may not matter
>   - we can build 2 stories taller if we partner
>     - more steady revenue + faster payoff
>     - less reliant on the success of the retail
>     - can revert to original design plan of 2 retail + 3 residential floors
>     - my terms are for:
>       - heavy architectural influence on facade and retail
>       - full autonomy in my own units
> 
>       - and either:
>       - implementation of my original concept but with elev&stair core area split
> 
>       -or- 
>       
>       - full retail floor control minus common lobby space
>       - control of (1) unit on each floor (preferably stacked, with option to duplex)
>       - handle building management for 1 addtl 4th floor unit 
> 
> [] if rohan wants to build at the same time
>   - what are our conditions?

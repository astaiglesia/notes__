# __URBANPLACE__

> **notes on the documentation:**
> * predominantly written in markdown with links to associated documents maintained by the server [] verify privatized repo
    -> view right within github or download and open within a code editor like vscode
    -> these documents will form the intellectual framework of the entity's digital identity - marketing, branding and social 
> * as complexity grows, notes will be efforted to be maintained for field changes but may not always be exactly current
> *** i.e. - please question + address any conflicts or inconsistencies
>  
> * that said.. please check the following terms below to clarify any initial confusion re: workshopped names and/or personal unofficial nomenclature, overlapping name uses, etc. will be updated with any new terms implemented when identified - 
> * [] does this need to live in its own document?
> * [] when properly updated for finalized names - this list should project a corporate identity and unified theme and/or program concepts

> **working/-shopped names**
> * *urbanplace* - the overall corporate identity of the property entity
> * [ "", *urbanhome* ] - the residential identity of the property
> * [ *urbancafe*, *urbanbrew*,  ] - the retail entity
> * [*the alcove*, ] - 'coffee-cart' park / entry area
> * the above list should also be treated as the defacto location to place impulsive insprations - 
> * remember that final signage designations should occur much later down the road as we will let the community dictate the direction we take with the main restaurant space
> * while I am open to being convinced otherwise, regardless of any other final selections, my preference as vision author at this point is urbanplace. i will only be swayed by arguments made by architect or generally design inclined...

## CASE STUDIES
why i'm here and doing this
> ****
> **for more detailed info on how i'm uniquely qualified to do this please refer to the organizationl bios. that said:
>  - **i'm looking to project a modern urban identity within the increasingly gentrified and dense city community which I grew up in since birth and have a hugely vested interest in providing my input in what direction the neighborhood I was born and raised in takes with the redevelopment of our childhood home**
> - **as a family of immigrant and first gen construction professionals that moved into and has owned the property for over 50 years, we not only understand urban planning and identity better than most, we have literally witnessed the neighborhood's evolution live and in real time and can each tell a lifetime of stories about living in jersey city. St.John's all through grammar school. Prep & ASA for high school...<add more>**
> - **if anybody can represent an organic and authentic jersey city image - past, present AND future, I can. we know we have this in the bag with a vision that will be:**
>   - 100% compliant with the redev plan's objectives and goals
>   - in particular, taking architectural cues from the surrounding neighborhood and historical elements we feel intimitely tied to
>   - provide the neighborhood with much needed services and a community where the locals can walk to, hang out and be locals

> please note the following as points of reference in the architecture and business patterns that inspire me in this venture

[] move to orgwriteup.vision and reword to reflect verbiage in the master plan
while the initial plan is to launch as a retail cafe & restaurant, my final vision is to modernize and *re-create and modernize the neighborhood hub where friends have always gotten together to be fed by my cooking, enjoy great music and food, hang out, play games, lounge about... that my house has and, with this project, will always will be*
- to this effect, with only the effort needed to reach out to each individual, we can literally have hundreds of jersey city residents (past and present) sign off that they have done any, and likely all, of these things, and in that house. if this business existed when I was a child, the place would probably be landmarked by now.

## DESIGN ANALYSIS 
<hr>
review images in redev plan, find elements to echo

### MEP
> [] MEP Consult on ROM design, informal discussions

### Arch
|--- *V2 REDESIGN PER JC REDEV & MASTER PLANS* ---|
> 
> [] what is restaurant category one and two???
> 
> [] [audit adherence to redev plan objectives](./zoning.md)
> [] investigate design option where we can step down into a subgrade urban cafe (approx current)
>   [] can we excavate for a full basement below that still? 
>   [] can we slide in an urban cafe mezz (vnitroblock)?
> [] facade considerations - materials, style
>     - considerations:
>       [] echo jstc style
>       [] echo stanley theater
>       [] if we can do a stepdown, echo original architectural style with stairs leading up to residential
> 
> 
> [] major design option consideration - All adaptive reuse of existing structures shall not be required to meet minimum building
> height requirements.
> 
> 
> [] balloon construction - woodframed residential on concrete retail
> 
> [] verify front setback
> 
> [] 'Ground floor level may extend to 100% of the lot... but part ii states all floors above the ground shall not extend more than 70 feet from any right of way fronting the subject property' 
> => the blue house behind us is basically what can be built
> => can we incorporate a greenhouse and/or skylight feature?
> 
> [] are we legally obligated to notify rohan?
>   - probably and if so, highly likely chance a partnership discussion will come up
>   - are we completely against this? 
>   - he can build 2 stories taller which may or may not matter
>   - we can build 2 stories taller if we partner
>     - more steady revenue + faster payoff
>     - less reliant on the success of the retail
>     - can revert to original design plan of 2 retail + 3 residential floors
>     - my terms are for:
>       - heavy architectural influence on facade and retail
>       - full autonomy in my own units
> 
>       - and either:
>       - implementation of my original concept but with elev&stair core area split
> 
>       -or- 
>       
>       - full retail floor control minus common lobby space
>       - control of (1) unit on each floor (preferably stacked, with option to duplex)
>       - handle building management for 1 addtl 4th floor unit 
> 
> [] if rohan wants to build at the same time
>   - what are our conditions?
>   
> 
> [] if rohan doesn't build at the same time 
>   - what can I do if he builds higher than me (ask city planning)
>   - vice versa

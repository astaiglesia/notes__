## Organizational Vision



> *urbanplace*
a mixed-rental/owner condo property providing townhouse, bi-level loft-style condo alternatives to the neighborhood's skyline. the residential build targets the burgeoning middle income market who love the area, want the luxury without the highrise feel or need for a complex of amenities. cool, modern, minimal with polished concrete, wood, steel, large/ full height glazing. pricepoint is slightly above the neighborhood but the developmental trajectory of the neighborhood that we would like to drive is incorporated into the vision

> *urbancafe*
in lieu of amenities, a mixed use cafe and lifestyle concept resides in the platform construction. successfully implementions encountered in california and prague (vnitroblock), the multi-aoned core business will appeal to the incoming demographic while the multi-zoned approach to managing the narrow width property is both echoed in the residential construction while also mazimizing revenue streams by crossing multiple demographics. 

this vision is driven by the belief that the neighborhood will maintain the current demographic of early to mid career professionals seeking an urban life that isn't incessantly manhattan - as all outskirt 'hipster' neighborhoods like Williamsburg, LA's Art's District, and Holesovice in Prague that begin as urban renewal projects and develops a higher end market for those that stick around. Jersey City's own Newport and Paulus Hook areas have seen this trajectory with the Heights developing its own persona... I believe that Journal Square will develop somewhere between the two


touchpoints:
- industrial vibe concrete, cmu, painted black steel metal pan feature staircase
- cool concrete greenhouse echoes the residences and provides an indoor-outdoor space and coupled with roll up doors creates a breezeway for decreased reliance on the energy grid
- 

servicing the neighborhood with *things it needs*
urbancafe is intentionally modular and industrially finished by design and so it can easily be reimagined and iterated on to serve the neighborhood's needs. that said - i truly believe my concept will be a hit snf includes:

> alcove 
  - building entrance, *park*-like seating area with coffee+smoothie stand (mimic astor place's mud outpost). 
  - rollup doors encourage walk-ins, easy sales, and an establishment with *open air ambience*
  - modular effect allows us to open for *breakfast drinks - shakes, smoothies, boba* way earlier than the rest of the spaces

> marketplace
  - the biggest x-factor 
  - marketplace + cafe option:
  * neighborhood needs *grocer options*, particularly with *gourmet / high end choices*... we don't have any *quality options* - I want to serve that need with *niche/foodie products* that echo the cafe's
  * cafe resources partially served by grocer
  * *beer and wine license with happy hours*, *brunches* that can also be served in the greenhouse and alcove

> greenhouse
  - *multi-purpose event space* and dining room
  - concept events scheduling:
    - *yoga studio*
    - *crossfit studio*
    - *dance studio*
    - *music studio*
    - *20p conferencing space*
    - *coworking cafe space*
    - *semi-public garden*

> thinkpod 
  - *small collaboration space / rentable conference room*
  - v3 vision includes flip up glazing allowing flex to performance stage

> unified vision
  - full space rent-out for events and performances
  - interior rollups can be opened to unify the space
    - artisanal markets in the alcove and greenhouse with inhouse food and bev

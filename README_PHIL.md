# Helpful Advice & Resources 

[approach](#keys) | [collections](#collections) |  [people](#people)  | [concepts](#concepts)

Hey Phil!

So my understanding is that first and foremost you're trying to maintain and upgrade your current tech stack centering around React and NextJS, with the possibility of capitalizing on the knowledge you gain from that.

Below is by no means a comprehensive list of resources and advice but a starting point. Different resources may have different teaching / writing / explanationstyles that may or may not work for you... and keep in mind that what works for you will be a moving target as you gain more experience and knowledge. 

Also, as i'm sure you know - there's ALOT involved and its impossible to onboard everything at once. so before we get into it all...

<h2 id="keys"> 3 important keys to  make things stick : </h2>
<hr>

> SPACED REPETITION IS THE KEY
> - start with a list of 5 - 10 key and pressing topics that you need to level up your game (e.g. state mgmt, component lifecycle, databases, accessibility, etc)
> - set aside chunks of time to hone in on key topics with deep dives of focused learning for that concept or topic
> - rotate to the next topic and add topics when you're ready
>   - especially earlier on try to focus on the actual topic rather than application of the knowledge to a specific project you have going on. 
>   - build out the small learner projects that are part of tutorials and courses as these are the building blocks of your component library.  
>   - as you learn how to implement the topics, e.g. accessibility, typecsript - you can modify, extend and apply what you've learned to your own project usage
  

> LEARN BY DOING, PARTICULARLY WITH OTHERS
> - reading code is great, you see other dev styles, get great ideas, see diff approaches, etc
> - but nothing, and EVERY course you can ever take will preach this, nothing can substitute actually hacking things out yourself
> - try watching tutorial / course videos at 2x speed before hacking - some have found trying to follow along very distracting in seeing the big picture
> - as much as possible - try to pair program with others, whether its algorithms or anything else. 
>   - especially if you want to build a career with these sckills, highly collaborative engineers that are able to effectively and efficiently communicate their thoughts and plans of actions both to their superiors and to younger devs is the hallmark of being a true mid to senior level engineer. the companies that offer the best developer experiences and pay seek these kind of engineers


>  MASTER THE FUNDAMENTALS
> (If you know any or all of these then take what you need)
> - ... but then you also know you can only master these concepts through spaced repetition
> - Next centers around React, React is built in JavaScript 
> - i.e. master javascript
> - OOP
> - asynchronous programming and concepts (this is how modern http requests work)
> - http requests 
> - closure
> - recursion
> - [big O analysis](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/)
> - basic data structures: [linked lists, stacks, queues, binary search trees]
> - basic sorting algos: [bubblesort, mergesort, insertionsort]

  



> honorable mentions - start getting comfortable with all things git and the command line (if you aren't already)
> - though everything can be googled and is conceptually easy, it does take time to master at least knowing what commands you should be googling
> - github desktop is beautiful and makes tons of things convenient BUT an abstraction of functionality should never be a replacement for understanding what's happening under the hood. this should be your rule of thumb for everything, including React. especially React.
> - synchronously practice your documentation / readme skills by taking all your notes in markdown from within a repo... this will do several things:
>   - you learn how to write in markdown (which is essentially a dumbed down version of html - and the standard format of writing documentation)
>   - trains you to organize and break down thoughts into digestible sections just just like a website or application
>   - trains you to commit regularly (and also starts to flesh out your github commit history)
>   - trains you to master the concept of co-locating your code (just like Next preaches)
>   - I highly suggest [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as its the gold standard  for IDE's amd built and maintained by an unassailable market giant. but really just taking your notes in your IDE in markdown will only help you become more proficient with your chosen tool. <if you rightclick on the filename, you can open a rendered preview of your markdown>

but lots to get into so i'm gonna dive right into it and just drop comments along the way.

a pattern that works for me is to try to get a high level overviews of something to get the big picture before drilling down

<br>

*free materials and books*
- https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books 
- [Eloqeunt JavaScript]() : classic must-read for any aspiring developer
- [Clean Code]() : see above note re: E.J.

<br>

*design patterns* 
[Javascript and React Patterns](https://www.patterns.dev/book) : really important patterns for understanding JS and React concepts from a big picture, engineering perspective
[system design]() : a more advanced topic that can really come alive with the various rendering options provided by Next

<br>

*courses*
- [front-end masters](https://frontendmasters.com/) : it's no coincidence that most of my favorite teachers can be found in this collection of courses

- udemy
- algo experts
- scrimba
- javascript 30
- freecodecamp
- https://csx.codesmith.io/ ---> i'd highly suggest really digging into this, particularly for the structure, workshops, pairing and networking aspects. especially if you're considering a bootcamp



*algo practice*
- codewars
- leetcode
- http://csbin.io/

> **NodeJS**
> to understand and work the non-React portions of Next it's important to realize that Next is running Node under the hood. If nothing else, you should at least understand all the concepts that surround Node
- [Docs are always a good place to start - Node has GREAT documentation]()

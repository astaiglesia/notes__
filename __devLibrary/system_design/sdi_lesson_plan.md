# System Design

> SDI Preparation
*sdi prep focuses on 2 crucial aspects*
- gain a deep understanding of fundamental system design concepts
- study and practice answering common sdi questions

> goals of an SDI: 

- demonstrate ability to design and implement a scalable system that can handle a ton of traffic, data, and users
- demonstrate problem-solving skills
- show how you make design decisions
- demonstrate effective communication

## study path
<hr>

re-learn fundamentals > do a few problems > design patterns block > do more problems

[] review fundamental system design concepts
[] select 5 init sdi questions
  [] complete 1st sdi-q

[] migrate/aggregate extg system design notes (algo-expert notes are in one note)
  [] complete 2nd sdi-q

[] deep dive design patterns
  [] complete 3rd sdi-q

[] refine terms and concepts with chat gpt reponses
  [] refactor defs to actual sdi responses
  [] complete 4th sdi-q

[] [what distinguishes candidates in an sdi](https://interviewnoodle.com/system-design-interviews-what-distinguishes-you-from-others-7095405ec48)
  [] complete 5th sdi-q
  [] select next sdi-q's

## fundamentals of system design
<hr>

* **be able to apply knowledge to real world scenarios**
* **understand concept application to different types of systems** => explain our designs' balance, tradeoffs and desirable system characteristics
* **be able to balance business requirements with the constraints and limitations of our designs**
<br>


### terms & concepts
 [18 system design concepts every engineer should know](https://www.designgurus.io/blog/system-design-interview-fundamentals)

> [] **Availability**

> [] **ACID Properties**

> [] **API Gateway**

> **Caching**
> - storing of frequently accessed data in a high speed storage layer
> - reduces the load on the underlying data store
> - improves system performance 

> [] **CAP Theorem**

> [] **CDN**

> [] **Checksum**

> [] **Consistency**

> [] **Databases**
      [] replication
      [] SQL / Relational
      [] Non-Relational / NoSQL
      [] indexing

> [] **Data Partitioning**
      [] horizontal / sharding
      [] vertical

> [] **Distributed Coordination Services**

> [] **Distributed File Systems**

> [] **Distributed Messaging Systems**

> [] **Domain Name System (DNS)**

> [] **Fault Tolerance** 
> - the ability of a system to continue functioning despite component(s) failure(s)
> - redundancy and load balancing can increase a system's fault tolerance

> [] **Full Text Search**

> [] **Heartbeat**

> [] **Latency**

> [] **Load Balancing / Balancer**
> - the optimization of resource usage and server loads by distributing workloads across multiple machines to prevent overloads

> [] **Microservices**

> [] **Notification System**

> [] **Partial Tolerance**

## SDI Problems

### how to answer an sdi-q
[the 7 step process](https://www.designgurus.io/blog/complete-guide-sys-design)
[time mgmt in the sdi](https://www.designgurus.io/blog/step-by-step-guide)
> **requirement clarification** : find and define the scope
> **back of the envelope estimation** : estimate the scale of the system
> **system interface definition** : define the necessary api's expected of the system
> **define the data model** : define the tables and layout
> **high level design** : describe the core components of the design system
> **detailed design** : dig deeper into 2 or 3 major components
> **identify and resolve bottlenecks** : discuss friction points and possible solutions

## Interview Tips
- utilize a similar approach to algo solving
- demonstrate your ability to anticipate and address potential issues in the design
  - acknowledging and addressing negative aspects and potential issues builds trust and credibility with the interviewer


> **COMMUNICATE YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS**
think out loud & talk through the problem <algotraining_skills!>
  
  - *restate the problem* 
    - note the system requirements and constraints
    - note initial points of consideration 
    - note possible approaches and tradeoffs
  - *break down the problem*
  - *use diagrams and sketches*
  - *discuss tradeoffs and constraints*
  - *provide support to your design choices*
  - *be prepared to answer questions on your design and provide alternatives*
  - *be open to feedback*



> **WHAT ARE THE EDGE CASES??**
  - *anticipate edges*
  - *plan for failure*
  - *consider scalability*
  - *consider security*
  - *explain your reasoning*

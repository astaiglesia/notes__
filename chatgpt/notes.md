> What is chatGPT?
    AI language model trained on text data generating converationally natural language responses

  **chat gpt is a conversational tool that can help find the right questions to ask while synthesizing large amounts of specifically tailored information**

> Benefits
    - Saves Time
    - Extend Reach Beyond Field of Expertise

> Outputs
    - Synthesize: process large amounts of content concisely
    - Content & Copy Creation: generate new content for specific topic and purpose
    - Learn & Research
    - Coding

> Purpose : 
    interactive tool to intelligently and iteratively process queries with responses that are personalized to user specs & prompts

> Input/Output : 
    queries occur in a conversational-style succession of questiosn to iterate and refine the ai's output
    
> Scope : 
    limited to the data the model's been trained on

### **Creating EFFECTIVE Prompts**

*Consider Levels of Explanations, Broad vs Narrow*

> explain xyz as... a 1st grader, grad student, leading expert
> top xyz  vs  top xyz for a beginner

<br>

*Consider the context of your prompt*
... define how you want chat gpt to engage with you

> you're going to act as...
> ignore all previous instructions
> respond with a friendly and casual tone
> respond with a serious and formal tone
> explain this to a 5 yr old
> you're an exercise and health expert. you've helped all ages of people


*Give your model a task to complete*
... aka compression vs decompression
> your task is to describe XYZ in XYZ words."     

*Be specific* 
> "do not include XYZ, remove this symbol/number."

*Ask questions*
...Further elaborate on specific outputs from the previous answer. 

> breakdown answer #5 of this list
> I don't like how the bridge sounds, can we change that to be more xyz..


*Consider the output* 
    
    If you donâ€™t like your results, refine your prompt to be as specific as possible.
    You have to work WITH chatGPT to get the answers that you want

*Modifiers & Prompt Ideas to Better Iterate on your Outputs*

    The choice of modifier you use will greatly impact the quality of your outputs

> What would I not think of on this topic
> What are some uncommon or lesser used approaches to this problem
> Give me something original around this topic that some people believe to be untrue

### Tokens
    - tokens represent chunks of data bits in the conversation
    - token limits noted are aggregates for both inputs and outputs
      - (mindmap limits as RAM capacity)
    - as the convesation approaches the token limit=> 
      responses can become: 
        - less accurate
        - less reliable
        - a bit more non-sensical
    - longer conversations exceeding the token limit will...
        - begin forgetting the beginning of the conversation to maintain token limit
        - subsequent responses will not encompass 'forgotten' information

GPT4 has an *8000 token limit*
GPT3 has an *3096 token limit*

|------------------------------------
|  *approximate conversions ratios* |
|                                   |
|  1 token == 4 chars == .75 words  |
|  100 tokens == 75 words           |
|  30 tokens == 1-2 sentences       |
|  100 tokens == 1 paragraph        |
|  2048 tokens == 1500 words        |
|------------------------------------

   *working around the token limit*
> prompt for a summary of the conversation to that point
> copy and paste into a new convo or just continue in the same conversation
> the summary will retain the relevent points to maintain context for the model and conversation

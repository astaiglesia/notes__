> What is chatGPT?
    AI language model trained on text data generating converationally natural language responses

  **chat gpt is a conversational tool that can help find the right questions to ask while synthesizing large amounts of specifically tailored information**

> Benefits
    - Saves Time
    - Extend Reach Beyond Field of Expertise

> Outputs
    - Synthesize: process large amounts of content concisely
    - Content & Copy Creation: generate new content for specific topic and purpose
    - Learn & Research
    - Coding



[ChatGPT:](https://chat.openai.com/auth/login)

> Purpose : 
    interactive tool to intelligently and iteratively process queries with responses that are personalized to user specs & prompts

> Input/Output : 
    queries occur in a conversational-style succession of questiosn to iterate and refine the ai's output
    
> Scope : 
    limited to the data the model's been trained on

### **Creating EFFECTIVE Prompts**

*Consider Levels of Explanations, Broad vs Narrow*

> explain xyz as... a 1st grader, grad student, leading expert
> top xyz  vs  top xyz for a beginner

<br>

*Consider the context of your prompt*
... define how you want chat gpt to engage with you

> you're going to act as...
> ignore all previous instructions
> respond with a friendly and casual tone
> respond with a serious and formal tone
> explain this to a 5 yr old
> you're an exercise and health expert. you've helped all ages of people


*Give your model a task to complete*
... aka compression vs decompression
> your task is to describe XYZ in XYZ words."     

*Be specific* 
> "do not include XYZ, remove this symbol/number."

*Ask questions*
...Further elaborate on specific outputs from the previous answer. 

> breakdown answer #5 of this list
> I don't like how the bridge sounds, can we change that to be more xyz..


*Consider the output* 
    
    If you donâ€™t like your results, refine your prompt to be as specific as possible 
    aka => 
        gold in == gold output
        garbage in == garbage output

    You have to work WITH chatGPT to get the output that you want

*Modifiers & Prompt Ideas to Better Iterate on your Outputs*

    The choice of modifier you use will greatly impact the quality of your outputs

> Qualifiers
> Adjectives
> Adverbs
> Intensifiers
> Negatives
> Number words
> Time words
> Place words
> Degree words

> What would I not think of on this topic?
> What are some uncommon or lesser used approaches to this problem?
> Give me something original around this topic that some people believe to be untrue

### Tokens
    - tokens represent chunks of data bits in the conversation
    - token limits noted are aggregates for both inputs and outputs
      - (mindmap limits as RAM capacity)
    - as the convesation approaches the token limit=> 
      responses can become: 
        - less accurate
        - less reliable
        - a bit more non-sensical
    - longer conversations exceeding the token limit will...
        - begin forgetting the beginning of the conversation to maintain token limit
        - subsequent responses will not encompass 'forgotten' information

GPT4 has an *8000 token limit*
GPT3 has an *3096 token limit*

|------------------------------------
|  *approximate conversions ratios* |
|                                   |
|  1 token == 4 chars == .75 words  |
|  100 tokens == 75 words           |
|  30 tokens == 1-2 sentences       |
|  100 tokens == 1 paragraph        |
|  2048 tokens == 1500 words        |
|------------------------------------

   *working around the token limit*
> prompt for a summary of the conversation to that point
> copy and paste into a new convo or just continue in the same conversation
> the summary will retain the relevent points to maintain context for the model and conversation

## Prompt Engineering
<hr>

**a specific limitation to note**
> current cutoff date for chat gpt training data is 09/2021

    this means that responses are only 'accurate' to that date ->
    i.e.
    - chatgpt is NOT an online search tool like google
    - static information like the laws of thermodynamics or pythagorean theorem WILL be correct
    - newer data like financial or sporting statistics from 2023 or the latest version of React will NOT be included in response synthesis

**to incorporate data that the AI was NOT trained on...**
> <prompt_priming> => inject / copy and paste the data or links to data into the conversation
> browser extensions exist 


## your output is only as good as the data the model was trained on...

**... and the prompts the user provides**

> the better the prompt, the better the output


> [] create prompt templates!

## Prompt Frameworks
<see guide for examples and more details>

> SHOT PROMPTING: priming prompts w/ params and ref data injections (aka shots)
    - types: [zero, one, multi-shot]
    formula: 'using xyz as reference ...'



<br>

> CHAIN OF THOUGHT PROMPTING: add transparency to the model with step by step reasoning included in the response
    formula: 'let's think step by step'



<br>

> TABULAR FORMAT PROMPTING: creating tables
    formula: 
        - query
        - 'what diff categories can your answer can be broken down to for more descriptiveness'
        - 'create a table including the original answer separated into diff columns per those categories'



<br>

> ASK BEFORE ANSWER PROMPTING: guide model to ask for clarifications before giving an answer, adding accuracy and specificity
    formula: 
        - 'you are..... but before you answer, I want you to ask  questions about..."
        - 'please ask any questions you have so that i can improve my prompt before you complete your task'


<br>

> FILL IN THE BLANK PROMPTING: encourages deeper thought processes, learning and communication
    formula:
        - <see guide>


<br>

> PERSPECTIVE PROMPTING: broaden your understanding with a comprehensive view of a topic for more informed decisions and nuanced understanding of complex topics



<br>

> CONSTRUCTIVE CRTITIQUE PROMPTING: provide objective and expert feedback, highlight areas for improvement and offer constructive criticism



<br>

> COMPARATIVE PROMPTING: highlight key similarities and diffs for more informed decisions and deeper understanding of strengths, weaknesses and tradeoffs



<br>

> REVERSE PROMPTING: reverse engineer content... what prompt would generate a provided sample text


<br>

*these establish a standardized format to optimize framign and performance*
<br>

> RGC PROMPTING


<br>

> I WANT YOU TO ACT AS PROMPTING: asking the model to assume a specific persona

## [wip] Simplify Complexity, Proofread & Reorganize Data   31m
   generative ai can parse through, digest and process data points and information at great scale and depth, from a multitude of perspectives and approaches - INCLUDING those which they may either be unaware of, don't know how to implement and/or unable to be handled by current resources or constraints
     
    
- some example tasks data processing
    *summarization* 
    provide a brief and concise cummary of the information, highlighting key points and main ideas / themes / style

    *paraphrasing* 
    restate the information in a different form, while retaining the same meaning and key information

    *bullet points*
    condesnse the information into a list of key takeaways as bullet points

    *keyword extraction*
    identify and list the key terms and phrases from the information

    *simplification*
    express the information at the comprehension level of a high school student | of a 5th grader | of a toddler

    *visual representation*
    generate a visual representation of the information (as a scatterplot | histogram | pie chart | 3d chart...)

    *comparison*
    compare the information to similar concepts or ideas to make it easier to understand

    *highlighting important information*
    emphasize teh most critical parts of the information


    *providing context*
    provide additional in formation or background to provide context to your response and make it more comprehsible
